Welcome to the Golang Chi API Server Template repository! This template is designed to provide you with a solid foundation for building a robust and efficient Golang Chi server. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with Golang, this template aims to streamline the process of setting up a powerful API server using the Chi router.

## Features:

### Chi Router

+ The template is built around the Chi router, a lightweight, flexible, and fast HTTP router for building web applications in Golang. Chi provides a rich set of features for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests, making it an excellent choice for creating RESTful APIs.

### Dockerized

+ To ensure portability and ease of deployment, this template comes pre-configured with Docker support. The Dockerfile included allows you to containerize your application effortlessly, enabling seamless deployment across different environments.

### Ready for Deployment

+ With the basic structure and necessary configurations in place, this template provides a quick boilerplate to get your API server up and running in no time. Whether you're deploying to a local development environment, staging, or production, the template aims to facilitate a smooth deployment process.

### Customizable Structure

+ The repository structure is organized to encourage modularity and scalability. It provides a starting point for your Golang Chi-based project while allowing easy customization and extension based on your specific requirements.
  Getting Started:

## Getting Started:

To begin using this template with Docker Compose, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdatz/go-chi-template
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd golang-chi-api-server-template
```

Build and start the application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the API server at http://localhost:2077 by default (or replace localhost with your Docker host).

## Docker Compose Configuration:

The docker-compose.yml file included in this template defines the services required for running the Golang Chi API server and can easily be extended to include any of your own services. It sets up the necessary environment for your application, including dependencies and network configuration.

## Start Developing!
Now that the Golang Chi API server template is set up, it's time to dive into building your API endpoints. Define routes using Chi's powerful routing capabilities and implement corresponding handlers to manage requests, allowing you to process data and provide appropriate responses. Leverage Chi middleware to enhance functionalities, intercept requests, and modify responses as needed. Whether it's logging, authentication, or error handling, custom middleware allows for fine-tuning your server behavior. Test your endpoints rigorously, utilizing tools like Postman or writing automated tests, ensuring smooth functionality and handling of diverse scenarios. Iterate on your codebase, refining endpoints and middleware to create a robust, efficient API server tailored to your application's requirements. Happy coding!
